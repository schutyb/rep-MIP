"""
Here we evaluate the phase/modulation and solo phase color image.
Given the convallaria image witch has many spectral phases, we expect to see a big change in colored images
with and without the modulation information.
0 - The data is a 2x2 HSI, wo it is used the concatenation and tile phasor algorithms.
1 - Plot the colored images in both cases
2 - Plot the phasor (the is no thresholded phasor, since there is no model, because it is only one image data)
